# MLB Stats

`MLB Stats` is a Python-based project that reads MLB statistics from a remote API, processes the data, and generates summary sheets for MLB players and teams. This project leverages the `pybaseball` module and other Python libraries to fetch, analyze, and format data for use in reports, dashboards, or other applications.

This project uses data sourced from MLB and Fangraphs.

## Sample Summary Sheets
Below are samples of the summary sheets that can be generated by this project. The first sample is a Batting Summary for Riley Greene for the 2024 season. The second sample is a Pitching Summary for Tarik Skubal for the 2024 season.
