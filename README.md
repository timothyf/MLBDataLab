# MLB Stats

`MLB Stats` is a Python-based project that reads MLB statistics from a remote API, processes the data, and generates summary sheets for MLB players and teams. This project leverages the `pybaseball` module and other Python libraries to fetch, analyze, and format data for use in reports, dashboards, or other applications.

This project uses data sourced from MLB and Fangraphs.
