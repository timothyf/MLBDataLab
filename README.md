# MLB Stats

`MLB Stats` is a Python-based application designed to fetch, process, and generate comprehensive summary sheets for MLB players and teams using data from remote APIs. By leveraging the [`pybaseball`](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) module, [`MLB-StatsAPI`](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI) module, and other Python libraries, the project facilitates the collection, analysis, and formatting of data for use in reports, dashboards, and other analytical tools.

The project sources data from MLB and Fangraphs, ensuring accurate and up-to-date statistics. Future updates will expand the application's features and functionality, allowing it to serve both as a standalone tool and as a library for integration into other projects.


## Sample Summary Sheets
Below are samples of the summary sheets that can be generated by this project. The first sample is a Batting Summary for Riley Greene for the 2024 season. The second sample is a Pitching Summary for Tarik Skubal for the 2024 season.

```bash
python scripts/save_statcast_data.py [options]

    --players [1 or more player names]
    --teams [1 or more team names]
    --year [specify a 4-digit year]
```

## Examples

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by my time working in the R&D department of the Washington Nationals, and the pitching summary project from Thomas Nestico. Here is a link to an article describing his project:
